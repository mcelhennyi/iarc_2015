# grab the line closest to 0 and index of that line,
# grab the line on either side of that line, with an index as well
# estimate where the 0th line will be based on Acceleration
# look at the array the next time around and check if it is in the correct index with the correct distance
        # If the line moves enough to change indices check that index for the correct distance
